          <div>How would you handle branding and theming for different hotels?</div>
          <p>
            With CSS prosessing, all the css variables can be easily modified with different css themes.
            See scss files in /app/styles

          <div>How should 10+ different languages be supported?</div>
          <p>
            The general idea is having string translation for each language and have the HTML template or view library
            to replace the string holder with the corresponding translation.
          </p>
          <textarea disabled style="height: 150px; font-size: 0.8em;">import lang_en from './i18n/en';
import lang_fr from './i18n/fr';

const lang = {
  en:lang_en,
  fr:lang_fr
}

&lt;SomeComponent strings={lang[en]}/&gt;</textarea>
          <p>
            There is an community module react-translate to help replacing text based on the string key.
            <br/>For AngularJS, it support intenationalization and localization which makes setting locales rules easier.
            There are also community supported modules like angular-translate to help the app interface to show different translation.

          <div>How should 10+ different currencies be supported?</div>
          <p>
            There could be couple methods to support that. However, I would prefer the following for hotel client. <br/>
            Store price in a base currency ( like US/Euro ) with the conversion rates in the data and generate multiple currencies in hourly, daily basis.<br/>
            This only require one set of exchange rates instead of basing all other local currencies.
            Also, this makes more sense for business since some currencies do not have a stable exhange rate.<br/>
            For example, in my home town Macau, we have our own currecy call Pataca but most casinos only accept Hong Kong dollars and US dollars.
            Another example, last year we went to Turkey and most hotels only accept US dollars and Euro.

        <li>
          <div>How would you handle no offers available if there are no matching rules?</div>
          <p>
            According to the spec, this case is not mentioned. During the meeting with the project manager or stake owner, this should be cleared out.
            For suggestion, I would highly recomment to have a fallback offer if no featured offers are available instead of showing message saying no offer.
            The client don't want to miss any chance for business.
